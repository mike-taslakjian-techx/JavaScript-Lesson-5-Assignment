# JavaScript: Lesson 5 Assignment

Files to submit:

index.html

main.js

...etc – based on how you decide to organize the code


Part A: API and Async Logic

In main.js, fetch user data from the following API with a delay:

> GET https://reqres.in/api/users?delay=1

> Header: x-api-key: reqres-free-v1



Part B: Page Interaction

Build a basic page in index.html.

The page should:

Include two buttons:

“Fetch with Header” – for the success case

“Fetch without Header” – to simulate a failed request

When either button is clicked:

Immediately show “Loading...” in the UI

Log to the console: Fetching users...

Send a fetch request to the API

The first button must include the x-api-key: reqres-free-v1 header

The second button must omit the header

If the request succeeds:

Wait 1 extra second (using await, setTimeout and a Promise)

Log the response data to the console

Combine first_name and last_name using .map() in a new array

Show the full names in the UI (one per line)

Log to the console: Done.

If the request fails, or gives an invalid response, or there are no users:

Show “No users” in the UI

Clear the “Loading...” message after processing is complete.


NOTE:

Use fetch and Promises or async/await

Use setTimeout to simulate delay

Do not use innerHTML

No need to style the page
